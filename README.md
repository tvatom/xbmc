= How to update add-ons =

The add-ons that I upload should update by themselves within XBMC.
In case that they don't, follow the steps below.


== How to force update ==

In XBMC:
 * Select _System_.
 * Select _Add-ons_.
 * Select _Get Add-ons_.
 * Highlight _Averre addons_, and either press *C* on the keyboard, or *right-click* with the mouse.
 * You should have been presented with a dialog box with the following options:
  * Check for updates
  * Force refresh
  * Add-on information
 * Select _Check for updates_.
 * The previous step should be enough for the add-on to update. But in case that it doesn't work, select _Force refresh_, from the dialog box options.
